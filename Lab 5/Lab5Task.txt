Exercise L8.E1 – The Fibonacci sequence is defined with an integer n as,
F(n) = F(n −1) + F(n −2) for n > 2, where F(0) = 0,F(1) =1.
You have to develop a Python program to compute F(n) for a given integer n between 0 and 20.
Input:
0 < n < 20
Output:
F(n) < 2^(32)
Compute F(n) starting with n=2 and increment iteratively until the required value is obtained.
Follow the instructions below.
1. Create a text file containing the value of n . The text file needs to be saved in the same folder
where the source file has been saved. The file name will be given as input through the terminal.
2. Develop a Python function named “getNum” to read the number n from the file.
3. Develop a Python function named “show” to display the given value n and the computed value
of F(n) on the screen. (Expected output format Fibonacci(3) = 2 )
4. Develop a Python function named “saveFile” to write what was displayed in (3) above to a text
file named “result.txt”. This file should be in the same folder where the source file is.
5. The program should call the appropriate functions to achieve the task.
